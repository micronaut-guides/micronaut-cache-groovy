We can verify that the cache works as expected:

[source, groovy]
.src/test/groovy/micronaut/example/micronaut/NewsServiceSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/example/micronaut/NewsServiceSpec.groovy[]
----

<1> Indicates that a spec's feature methods should be run sequentially in their declared order.
<2> Annotation used to define a Micronaut test
<3> Inject `NewsService` bean.
<4> Timeout annotation fails a test if its execution exceeds a given duration. It helps us verify that we are leaveraging the cache.
